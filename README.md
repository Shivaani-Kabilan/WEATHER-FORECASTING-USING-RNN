# WEATHER-FORECASTING-USING-RNN
This is a weather prediction model using recurrent neural network inorder to predict the weather of next 4 days in the future, using the dataset containing the historical weather data. The temperature feature is implemented in this project and it can be done with other weather features like humidity, rainfall,etc , by  following the same procedures. By training the model for different number of  epochs, found the optimum number of epochs required to produce a good-fit weather prediction model that predicts with high accuracy.
